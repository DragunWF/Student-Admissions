# Student Admissions

## Description

Hello, this is an old project. It is a simple Java GUI app where you can apply a student based on the information you input _(With validation of input in the background)_. Furthermore, you can accept or reject students if you're on the _Admissions Officer_ menu. There's also a page where you can view all students that are applying and pending for registration.
